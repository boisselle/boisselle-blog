# A Brief Introductory Roadmap

Welcome to my corner of the Internet! 

This is an archive for my projects and writings. 

I chose to build this website in Astro due to its modernized development workflow, support for diverse libraries like Three.js, GSAP, Tailwind, and React, as well as its file-based routing, markdown support, and component-first architecture.

Although this website is starting out as a blog, my intention is to update it with different styles and purposes as my work evolves.

Ultimately, this is an experiment in using the Internet with more intentionality. A way that more closely embodies the ideas of early internet pioneers and the hacker culture ethos. Terence McKenna described the vision born of this ethos well when he said:

> I can imagine a child of the future... we all bring home our drawings to stick on refrigerators and things like that. In the future, we won't stick them on refrigerators. We will stick them on our website.
>
>Everything will go into our website, and by the time we're 25 or something, our website will be the size of the American Museum of Natural History, and you can wander through it. 
>
>And as a gesture of intimacy you can invite someone else to wander through it. Well that's who you are. It's your imagination.

Welcome to my imagination. Thanks for being here!
