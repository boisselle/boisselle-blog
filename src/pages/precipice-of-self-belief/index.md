# On the Precipice of Self-Belief

Published on: September 27, 2024

I recently came across a video of
<a href="https://youtu.be/5DJaWWwITRM?si=iI5CLfWDpQ0OzA_j" target="_blank">Larry Ellison's 2016 commencement speech at USC</a> and it was a beautiful reminder not to allow myself to be defined by the context of modern times.

In his speech, he talked about how his wife divorced him because she thought he lacked ambition. Yes, We're talking about the $203 Billion net worth Larry Ellison (as of today's date). 

He mentions how he couldn't find a software engineering job that he felt fulfilled in, even though he was employed as a programmer. Ultimately he wanted to build his own company to create the job he wanted. And history was born!

This is a reminder to be a little more creative, to pursue your interests a little bit more. If you're thinking of trying something: try it, don't just *think* about trying it! Develop your interests. 

This is as much a reminder to myself as it is for anyone reading this.

Scheduling the day helps. You have to make time for yourself. And the bigger the goal, the bigger the vision, the more time in the day you have to set aside for yourself.

This is also a reminder not to get discouraged if other people don't immediately see greatness within you or if they don't believe in you. Even a future billionaire's own wife didn't believe in him. 

Don't take it personal. Only you know what you are capable of.

Keep going.
