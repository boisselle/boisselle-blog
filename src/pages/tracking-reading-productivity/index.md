# Toward Specifications for Tracking Reading Productivity

Published on: September 22, 2024

Reading requires a good deal of focus.

Choosing what to read seems to be a very important thing. But I find that volume of reading is even more important. You can't fully rely on book reviews to help you choose. 

Mortimer Adler in his book *How to Read a Book* lists 4 different types of reading:

Elementary, Inspectional, Analytical, and Syntopical.

Elementary is the basic type of reading that you go through in grade school. Inspectional is when you start to pick it apart. Analytical is when you start to cross-examine different sections of the book and really break things down. Syntopical brings together a set of books to make comparisons and contrasts and come up with an overall synthesis of them.

I'm trying to map out a system of reading that will help me stay productive, while working toward a certain goal. 

Some elements of a good reading productivity system:

- a page where you can have your books listed
- a page where you can have your notes attached to each book
- a timer that you click when you start and stop reading.
- a place where you can view all reading sessions related to a book.
- an overall rating for a book.
