# Toward Specifications for Tracking Reading Productivity

Published on: September 22, 2024

I've been thinking lately about how to improve my reading speed and comprehension. I feel the constant need to optimize my learning. To that end, I'm working to map out and design a system for reading that will help me stay productive and maximize my learning efficiency. 

At minimum, the productivity tracking system should include:

- a page listing books in progress, completed, and wishlist
- a scheduling component that reminds you of reading time by email or sms.
- a page/folder system for notes related to each book.
- a timer that you click when you start and stop reading.
- a page to view all reading sessions related to a book.
- an analytics dashboard that tracks progress.
- a page linking to secondary source material related to the book.

The goal of the minimum viable product is to test a minimal set of features and learn what needs to be changed along the way. I'd also like others to test and use the application if they find it useful. If you'd like to try it, or have suggestions, connect with me and let me know!
