# Megalopolis: The Most Expensive Art House Film Ever Produced.

Published on: September 28, 2024

With a budget of $120 million, this movie is the most expensive ode to scientists, artists and visionaries ever produced. It has the aesthetic of an art house film, yet the cast of a Hollywood blockbuster. But if you go into this expecting to see something like The Godfather or Apocalypse Now, relinquish that expectation immediately.

The on-screen happenings feel schizophrenic and, at times, borderline hallucinogenic. The film is grandiose in its attempt but has difficulty portraying this grandiosity in a traditional story format.

The narrative structure is so fractured that it tempts the viewer to question whether it could be a criticism of contemporary society or just a poorly executed movie. In a sense, this movie defies numerical review. I want to simultaneously give it one star and five stars.

Visually and aesthetically you should expect a work that is sometimes incoherent yet never unpleasant, and often stimulating. Frequently boring but never without gems. That said, it might have been better if Coppola released it on YouTube for a tenth of the budget. But then again, that would be a technical feat in itself.

The acting and set design are top notch, and the film is sprinkled with inspiring dialogue throughout. But we are never really sure why we should care about the characters. We are barely made aware of their internal motivations.

All things considered, I would say this is a must-see. But it’s something that requires marination time. It does warrant a second viewing. If only to confirm that it's just *that* bad, or... *that good.* I still haven't made up my mind on that front.

Hyper-experimental at its core, it probably won’t be remembered as one of his greats. But the ideas and messages contained within are some of the greatest and most noble and inspiring messages Coppola has ever espoused in cinema format.
