    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>It's pronounced "bwah-zelle." Pardon my French!</p>
    <p>But you can call me Sean.</p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer with 3 years of experience specializing in full-stack development, rapid prototyping, and user interface design. <p>I'm passionate about utilizing modern design principles to craft beautiful user experiences.</p>
        
        <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Florida. My current tech stack includes React, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind, and Django.</p>

    <p>I'm also familiarizing myself with the mathematics foundations of machine learning with the help of <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html" target="_blank">Probabilistic Machine Learning</a> by Kevin Murphy.</p>
        
    <p>When I'm not marveling about the beauty of computation and design, I also like to dabble in videography, video editing, and writing.</p>
